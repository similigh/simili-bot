# v0.0.2v Foundation Integration Session

**Started:** 2026-02-02 09:41  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

---

## Session Overview

Development session focused on implementing v0.0.2v, which integrates Gemini AI, Qdrant vector store, and GitHub API into the modular pipeline architecture established in v0.0.1v.

---

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Integrate Gemini embeddings (`gemini-embedding-001`) and LLM (`gemini-2.0-flash-lite`)
- Integrate Qdrant vector store for semantic search
- Implement GitHub API client for issue operations
- Wire all integrations into existing pipeline steps
- Implement CLI `process` command
- Add file headers to all existing code

### Success Criteria
- Full pipeline executes end-to-end
- Similarity search works with real embeddings
- LLM triage analysis produces actionable results
- CLI can process issues locally
- All tests pass

---

## Progress

### Planning Phase ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-02 09:41

- ✅ Reviewed v0.0.1v architecture and existing codebase
- ✅ Analyzed GitHub issues for v0.0.2v milestone (5 issues)
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan (`DOCS/0.0.2v/plan.md`)
- ✅ Created task breakdown with 11 phases
- ✅ Confirmed environment setup (`.env` configured with API keys)
- ✅ Created documentation structure (`DOCS/0.0.2v/`)

**Key Decisions:**
- Use `gemini-embedding-001` for embeddings (768 dimensions)
- Use `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` for LLM (fast, cost-effective)
- Follow "implement → test → commit" workflow
- Add mandatory file headers to all Go files

---

### Phase 1: Code Standards & File Headers ⏳
**Status:** Not Started

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add file headers to `cmd/simili/`
- [ ] Add file headers to `internal/core/`
- [ ] Add file headers to `internal/steps/`
- [ ] Commit: `docs: add file headers to existing codebase`

## Commits

### Planning
- *No commits yet - planning phase complete*

---

## Notes

- Environment configured with Gemini API key, Qdrant URL/API key, and GitHub token
- Following Go optimization guidelines (idiomatic code, proper error handling)
- Using conventional commit format for all commits
- Testing each phase before moving to next

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Add file headers to existing codebase
2. Commit changes
3. Move to Phase 2: Gemini integration
